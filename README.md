# simple-text-replacement-for-git-branch-name

since git branch name can not contain space, so need to replace space to acceptable character like "-" or "_".
here we choose "-" by default.

Yes, the tool just replace " "(space) with "-" in origin text.
after replacement done, the result string will appear in bottom result, and pasted to clipboard.
